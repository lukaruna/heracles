# Backend
## Table of Contents



### Setup

This app needs the following to work:

- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) - LTS version will do

### How to run

I am using npm for package management. After running `npm install`:
 
 - To run the backend, all you need to do is to run `npm start`;
 - To run the functional tests tests, run `npm test`;
 - To run mutation tests, run `npm run mutation-test`;
 - To verify contracts generated at the consumer (needs to run pact at the front-end first), run `npm test-pact`

### Additional notes

 - When running mutation-tests, a `reports` folder will be generated.
