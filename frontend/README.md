# Frontend
## Table of Contents



### Setup

This app needs the following to work:

- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) - LTS version will do

### How to run

I am using npm for package management. After running `npm install`:
 
 - To run the frontend, all you need to do is to run `make run`;
 - To run the unit tests, run `make test`;
 - To run contract (consumer) tests, run `make pact` (this will generate a folder pacts);
